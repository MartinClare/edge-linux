# AXON Vision CMP — Edge Webhook API

This file lives in **`CCTVCMP-linux`**, the standalone Linux-oriented CMP copy bundled with the **edge-linux** repository. It is maintained as a **separate tree** from any older `CCTVCMP` naming or external repo layout — paths below are relative to `CCTVCMP-linux/`.

This document describes the webhook endpoint that receives AI safety analysis reports from edge cameras and automatically triggers incident detection, LLM classification, and alarm evaluation.

**Live endpoint:**
```
https://cctvcmp.vercel.app/api/webhook/edge-report
```

---

## Authentication

Every request **must** include an API key in the request header:

```
x-api-key: YOUR_EDGE_API_KEY
```

The key is set via the `EDGE_API_KEY` environment variable on Vercel. Requests without a valid key return `401 Unauthorized`.

> **Setup:** Go to Vercel → your project → Settings → Environment Variables → add `EDGE_API_KEY` with a strong secret value.

---

## Canonical edge device (edge-linux monorepo)

The Python edge service in the **parent** `edge-linux` repo (not inside `CCTVCMP-linux/`) sends **JSON only** (`Content-Type: application/json`) from `python/app/alarm_observer.py` → `_send_to_central_server`, using the payload shape built by **`python/app/cmp_webhook.py`** (`build_edge_report_json_body`) so field names stay aligned with **`CCTVCMP-linux/lib/validations/webhook.ts`** (`edgeReportSchema`).

Each POST includes:

- `edgeCameraId`, `cameraName`, `timestamp` (UTC ISO string)
- `analysis`: nested object with `overallDescription`, `overallRiskLevel`, `constructionSafety`, `fireSafety`, `propertySecurity`, `peopleCount`, `missingHardhats`, `missingVests`

It does **not** send `messageType`, `keepalive`, or `eventImageIncluded` (CMP treats these as **analysis / not keepalive / no image**). It does **not** send JPEG evidence; optional multipart + image is supported for other clients.

CMP accepts minor Gemini variance: risk level in any casing, partial safety objects, and optional `null` fields.

### Heartbeat vs “analysis every N seconds”

On **edge-linux** `main`, the Python service does **not** send a separate JSON field named “heartbeat” to the CMP. What you get instead is a **full analysis POST** on each Deep Vision cycle (`geminiInterval`), which still updates the camera’s **last report** time on the CMP — that behaves like a liveness signal.

If your edge build **does** send explicit keepalives, CMP accepts any of the following (case-insensitive where noted):

- `keepalive: true` (or string `"true"`)
- `messageType`: `"keepalive"` or `"heartbeat"`
- `type` or `eventType` (or `event_type`): `"heartbeat"` or `"keepalive"`

Keepalive posts **do not** run LLM classification or alarm evaluation; they still create an `edge_reports` row and refresh the camera `online` / `last_report_at` state when valid.

## Endpoint

### `POST /api/webhook/edge-report`

Receives a structured safety analysis report from an edge AI camera device.

**Behaviour after receiving a report:**
1. Saves the raw report to `edge_reports` table
2. Updates the camera's `last_report_at` and marks it `online`
3. Auto-creates the camera record if it doesn't exist yet
4. Runs LLM classification in the background (via OpenRouter / Gemini)
5. Evaluates configured alarm rules and creates incidents if triggered
6. Dispatches notifications if notification channels are configured
7. Returns `200` JSON `{ "success": true }` immediately so the edge device is not blocked

## Response

### `200 OK` — Success

```json
{ "success": true }
```

The report has been persisted and the camera `lastReportAt` updated. For actionable analysis (not keepalive), LLM classification and alarm evaluation run **asynchronously after** this response returns (see `app/api/webhook/edge-report/route.ts`).

### `401 Unauthorized`

```json
{ "message": "Unauthorized" }
```

Missing or incorrect `x-api-key` header.

### `400 Bad Request`

```json
{ "message": { "fieldErrors": { ... }, "formErrors": [] } }
```

Payload failed schema validation. Check the `fieldErrors` for which fields are missing or invalid.

---

## How Classification Works

After saving the report, the system runs a **hybrid classifier**:

### Step 1 — Numeric PPE check (always runs)
- If `missingHardhats > 0` or `missingVests > 0` → `ppe_violation` is immediately flagged with `confidence: 1.0`
- This does not require an LLM

### Step 2 — LLM classification (requires `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`)
- Sends the analysis to **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** via OpenRouter
- Classifies all 8 incident types based on natural language descriptions
- If no API key is set, falls back to keyword matching

### Step 3 — Fallback keyword classifier
- Runs if LLM is unavailable
- Scans `issues` arrays for known keywords per incident type

### Incident types classified

| Type | Trigger signal |
|---|---|
| `ppe_violation` | `missingHardhats` or `missingVests` > 0 |
| `fall_risk` | Issues containing: fall, height, scaffold, ladder, guardrail |
| `fire_detected` | Issues containing: active fire, flame, burning, blaze |
| `smoke_detected` | Issues containing: visible smoke, smoldering |
| `restricted_zone_entry` | Issues containing: intrusion, unauthorized, trespass |
| `machinery_hazard` | Issues containing: crane, forklift, excavator, heavy equipment |
| `smoking` | Issues containing: smoking, cigarette, tobacco |
| `near_miss` | Detected by LLM from context |

---

## Alarm Rules

Incidents are only created when an alarm rule is configured for that incident type. Default rules are seeded automatically on first use.

Rules can be configured at:  
**`https://cctvcmp.vercel.app/settings`** → Alarm Rules tab

| Rule setting | Description |
|---|---|
| `minRiskLevel` | Minimum risk level to trigger the alarm |
| `minConfidence` | Minimum classifier confidence (0.0–1.0) |
| `consecutiveHits` | Number of consecutive detections before triggering |
| `dedupMinutes` | Minutes to wait before re-triggering the same incident type |
| `recordOnly` | If true, saves the incident but does not raise an alert |

---

## Camera Auto-Registration

If `edgeCameraId` is not found in the database, the system **automatically creates** the camera record and assigns it to:
- The first available project (or creates "Edge Site" if none exists)
- The first available zone (or creates "Default" zone if none exists)

To pre-assign a camera to a specific project and zone, create the camera record manually via `POST /api/edge-devices` before the first report arrives.

---

## Environment Variables Required

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Neon PostgreSQL connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | JWT signing secret for user sessions |
| `EDGE_API_KEY` | Secret key required by all edge camera devices |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | *(Optional)* OpenRouter API key for LLM classification |

Set all variables in **Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables**, then redeploy.
